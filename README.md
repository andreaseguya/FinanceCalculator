Finance Calculator

The income estimator was built as a resource in aiding investment management and determining the feasibility of a business idea.
The application has  3 main components; the questionnaire, calculators and the loan tool. Each of these provide recommendations based on user data entered and aid in determining the feasibility of a business idea.
The calculators use HTML forms to collect values and compute financial terms such as Net Present Value of an investment.
The data from these forms is then passed into a Javascript function that computes the values and provides recommendationas based on results

Tools Used:
• HTML
• CSS
• JavaScript
• React
• FinanceJS

Stages of Development:
The first step is to compare and research other resources that aid in investment management.
 Some interesting ideas were a stock simulator game, a mock investment portfolio application and individual NPV, IRR, BCR calculators.
 The next stage involves designing the overall layout of the application,implementing functionality and testing the protoype.
Prototyping tools such as figma were used to speed up the development of front end elements
Libraries such as FinanceJS and StockJS aided in the back-end development of the application.
